# Where to start

In case you don't have any idea where to start, this document is here to make you second-think ever considering learning AI in the first place. 

All jokes aside, there are a lot of things to consider and paths to follow and there is no right glove fits them all.  AI may seem daunting and challenging at times, but rewarding when you see your baby out in the wild. 

If you have any questions and need a bone-headed but relentless software dev to brainstorm your ideas with, join [our discord server](https://discord.gg/aTrHsAghxG).

## How to setup the project
Follow the steps in the [README.md](../../README.md), dummy. But in case you have any issues some other dummy (probably me) will have to fix it. 

Ping us if you have any troubles setting up the environments or running the code.

## How to collect data


## Ain't got no image processing experience
The crème de la crème when it comes to processing images in Python is good old [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html) - described by Google Search as a library which **allows you to perform image processing and computer vision tasks**.

A few things you can do with OpenCV are:
* [cropping](https://learnopencv.com/cropping-an-image-using-opencv/)
* [edge detection](https://learnopencv.com/edge-detection-using-opencv/)
* [color filtering](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57469394/opencv-choosing-hsv-thresholds-for-color-filtering)
* [warping](https://thinkinfi.com/warp-perspective-opencv/)
* [contour detections](https://learnopencv.com/contour-detection-using-opencv-python-c/)

## Ain't got no machine learning experience
Your up to a bumpy ride, cuz things gonna go wild when trying to figure out where to start. 

If you wanna get up the hype-train and learn what all the cool guys and gals are doing, you'll want to learn of [Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4&list=PLSVEhWrZWDHQTBmWZufjxpw3s8sveJtnJ).

A few things that you can consider:
* **supervised learning** (a.k.a. mokey see, mokey do) - an expert (or in the lack of, you) collects data and gives it as example to a model to fit it the best it can ([source1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0js1Mr6hi2U))
* **reinforcement learning** (a.k.a. acting like a toxic parent) - design a model and reward function and throw the model into the wild. If it does well it will receive a positive reward and will try to exploit it at maximum because that's the only way it will win your grace ([source1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tnu4O_xEmVk))

*note*: Funny enough, reinforcement learning is the hardest of them all, but some people have an innate attraction towards it.

You're a masochist and need more reasons to quit learning ML? You can also look into:
* **classical machine learning** - where you have to design the features (dumbed-down representation of the data/manually extracted information from data) and spoon feed your model 'till it succeeds ([source1](https://kapernikov.com/tutorial-image-classification-with-scikit-learn/))
* **unsupervised learning** (a.k.a. learning with no documentation) - make an AI figgure out patterns in your data and you make the best out of it ([source1](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/unsupervised_learning.html))
* **genetic algorithms** (a.k.a. playing God) - you're practically putting randomly initialized graphs into the wild and keeping/breeding only those which are most "inteligent" of the pack ([source1](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))
